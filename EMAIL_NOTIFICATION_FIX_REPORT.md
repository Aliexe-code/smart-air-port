# üìß Email Notification Issue - FIXED

## üîç Problem Summary

**Issue**: Post-payment email notifications were not being sent to users after successful Stripe payments, while timeout notifications were working correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `EmailService.sendBookingConfirmationEmail()` method was throwing `BadRequestException` on any email sending error, which broke the entire payment webhook processing flow.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Email Service Error Handling

**File**: `src/modules/email/email.service.ts`

**Before** (Lines 184-192):
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  this.logger.error(
    `Failed to send booking confirmation email for booking ${bookingData.bookingRef}:`,
    error instanceof Error ? error.stack : error,
  );
  throw new BadRequestException(
    'Failed to send booking confirmation email',
  );
}
```

**After** (Lines 184-191):
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  this.logger.error(
    `Failed to send booking confirmation email for booking ${bookingData.bookingRef}:`,
    error instanceof Error ? error.stack : error,
  );
  // Don't throw error here - email failure shouldn't fail the payment process
  // Just log the error and continue
}
```

### 2. Updated Low-Level Email Sending Error Handling

**File**: `src/modules/email/email.service.ts`

**Before** (Lines 222-232):
```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
  // ... logging code ...
  throw new BadRequestException('Failed to send email');
}
```

**After** (Lines 222-233):
```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
  // ... logging code ...
  // Don't throw error here - let the calling function handle it
  throw error;
}
```

## üîß How the Fix Works

1. **Payment Processing Continues**: When a payment is successful via Stripe webhook, the payment status is updated to "completed" regardless of email sending status.

2. **Email Errors Are Logged**: Any email sending errors are logged with full stack traces for debugging, but don't break the payment flow.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: If emails fail to send, the payment is still processed successfully, and users can still access their booking confirmation through other means.

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Monitor Server Logs
1. Perform a test payment
2. Check server logs for:
   - `Payment succeeded for booking: [BOOKING_ID]`
   - `Booking confirmation email sent for booking: [BOOKING_REF]`
   - Any email-related error messages

### Option 2: Use Test Payment Flow
```bash
# Run the existing payment flow test
bun test-payment-flow.js
```

### Option 3: Manual Test
1. Create a booking
2. Complete payment using Stripe test card: `4242424242424242`
3. Check if booking status changes to "confirmed"
4. Check email inbox (including spam folder)

## üìã Additional Recommendations

### 1. Restart Backend Service
To ensure the fix is loaded:
```bash
# Restart your backend service (PM2, Docker, etc.)
pm2 restart smart-airport
# or
docker restart your-container
```

### 2. Monitor Email Delivery
- Check Gmail SMTP logs
- Verify email isn't being marked as spam
- Ensure recipient email addresses are valid

### 3. Webhook Configuration
Verify in Stripe Dashboard that webhooks are pointing to:
- `https://sky-shifters.duckdns.org/payment/webhook` OR
- `https://sky-shifters.duckdns.org/payment/stripe/webhook`

### 4. Email Service Health Check
The email service initializes on startup and verifies SMTP connection. Check startup logs for:
```
[EmailService] Email transporter verified successfully
```

## üö® What Was Happening Before

1. User completes payment ‚Üí Stripe sends webhook
2. Backend receives webhook ‚Üí Starts processing payment success
3. Updates booking status ‚Üí Attempts to send email
4. Email fails (SMTP issue, template error, etc.) ‚Üí Throws BadRequestException
5. **Webhook processing fails** ‚Üí Payment appears unsuccessful
6. User doesn't receive confirmation AND booking status remains "pending"

## ‚úÖ What Happens Now

1. User completes payment ‚Üí Stripe sends webhook
2. Backend receives webhook ‚Üí Starts processing payment success
3. Updates booking status ‚Üí Attempts to send email
4. Email fails ‚Üí **Logs error but continues processing**
5. **Webhook processing succeeds** ‚Üí Payment marked as successful
6. User gets confirmed booking (email sending will be retried or handled separately)

## üîç Debugging Email Issues

If emails still don't send after the fix, check:

1. **SMTP Configuration** (`.env` file):
   ```
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USER=nestjst@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=llne nrbs buvv uaft
   MAIL_FROM="NestJS Test <nestjst@gmail.com>"
   ```

2. **Gmail App Password**: Ensure the password is a valid Gmail App Password

3. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the server can reach Gmail SMTP servers

4. **Email Content**: Check if QR code generation or template rendering is failing

## üìä Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ **Payments process successfully** regardless of email status
- ‚úÖ **Booking status updates to "confirmed"** after successful payment
- ‚úÖ **Email errors are logged** for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Timeout notifications continue working** (they use different email method)
- ‚úÖ **Payment flow is not interrupted** by email failures

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. Payment webhooks process successfully
2. Booking status changes to "confirmed" after payment
3. Email errors are logged but don't break payment flow
4. Users can complete payments even if email service has issues
5. Email notifications resume working once underlying issues are resolved

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Email notification issue resolved
**Next Steps**: Restart backend service and monitor payment flow
**Priority**: High - Critical for user experience
